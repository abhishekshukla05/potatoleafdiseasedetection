# Potato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN
## Overview
This project focuses on classifying potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of potato leaves into different disease categories, such as late blight, early blight, and healthy leaves.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of labeled images of potato leaves. It includes images of healthy leaves as well as leaves affected by different diseases. The dataset can be obtained from [source/URL].

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.9
- TensorFlow 2.11.0
- Keras 2.2.5
- flask 2.3.2
